### Hi, I'm Libor!
I'm a freelance software & machine learning developer. I focus on computer vision and I'm very enthusiastic about explainable AI. I started a blog [xplainer.ai](https://xplainer.ai/), closely connected to an [xplainer.ai toolkit](https://github.com/liborvaneksw/xplainer). 

In addition to that
- I contribute to some other repositories as well, maily a 
  [Centernet & TTFnet implementation](https://github.com/Ximilar-com/xcenternet) in Tensorflow 2.2+.
- I'm blogging on [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/@libor_vanek) from time to time.
- You can meet me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/libor-vanek/).
